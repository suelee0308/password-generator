# password-generator

 ## User Story:
 As an employee with access to sensitive data, I wasnt to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria so that I can create a strong password that provides greater security. 

 ## Criteria:

 1. The password is between 8-128 characters long

 And

2. The password contains at least one of the following character types: number, lowercase, uppercase, special character


## Resources used:
1. Adding event listener: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/tryit.asp?filename=tryjsref_onclick_addeventlistener

2. While loops: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_while.asp

4. Object values: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/values

5. Split string instead of me separating each in an array: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_split.asp

6. Joining array into a string: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12132178/using-join-method-to-convert-array-to-string-without-commas/12132215
